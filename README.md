# PothuHole üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Bugs

### Project Description
"PothuHole" (a play on "Pothole" and the Malayalam word "Pothu" for Public) is a revolutionary web app that turns the civic duty of reporting public holes into a fun, competitive, and shareable experience. Users can upload photos of potholes, rate their danger level with a satisfying slider, and see all reported hazards on an interactive map. It‚Äôs not just about fixing roads; it‚Äôs about making bureaucracy fun with a touch of local Mallu humor.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Reporting potholes is a dull, soul-crushing process that involves navigating drab government websites. Plus, there's no way to express the true emotional and spinal damage a particularly nasty pothole inflicts upon you and your vehicle. The world desperately needed a way to gamify road maintenance.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've built a platform where every pothole report is a chance for glory! Our app assigns a "Danger Level" to each pothole, accompanied by a witty, context-aware Malayalam quote. Users can climb the district leaderboard, share hilarious, auto-generated "Pothole Warning" cards on social media, and finally give a voice to the silent suffering of their car's suspension.
